    "Missing completely at random (MCAR) is a type of missing data mechanism in which the probability of a value being missing is unrelated to both the observed data and the missing data. In other words, if the data is MCAR, the missing values are randomly distributed throughout the dataset, and there is no systematic reason for why they are missing.\n",
